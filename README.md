## Nimbus

Nimbus is a minimalistic static site generator I created for my blog.

### Usage
```bash
npx github:flawiddsouza/nimbus content-folder-with-markdown folder-for-generated-html
```

You can find a sample content folder at [/content-sample](/content-sample) and the resulting output at [/dist-sample](/dist-sample).
